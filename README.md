# response-optimization
Buildings and other structures can be optimised for their response to vibrations. This repository provides a python 3 module that does just that.

The module was written for 1D linear equations of motion, formulated with the direct method. This means the mass matrix is diagonal and every entry correponds to one particular degree of freedom of the system.

The optimization is then carried out in the frequency domain.
